  heroDescription:
  "I’m Barath Stalin, a passionate Information Security Engineer with a strong focus on Product Security, Vulnerability Assessment, and Secure SDLC implementation. Over the past 3+ years, I’ve worked across FinTech, POS, and SaaS environments helping organizations strengthen their security posture, automate assessments, and align with global compliance standards like PCI DSS, RBI, ISO 27001, and NPCI. I’m passionate about uncovering critical vulnerabilities, architecting proactive defenses, and empowering developers to build securely from the start. For me, security isn’t just a checklist it’s about fostering trust, resilience, and awareness across every layer of technology. In my free time, I engage in bug bounty programs, discovering impactful security flaws in products from leading organizations.",
